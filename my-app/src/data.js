I'm not sure if it's because Grandma is there and is always super welcoming or if it's because it's such a prime location away from central Tokyo. Residential, clean, accessible, and voted the most liveable place in all of Japan for 2019.",

The lake was obviously the main attraction but all the surrounding shops, restaurants, and businesses also didn't take away from the impressiveness of the town.",
